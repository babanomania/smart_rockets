# Smart Rockets

This project is based on the smart rocket work done by Dan Shiffman on the coding train youtube channel.
There will be 100 rockets fied randomly and they'll will attempt to hit thr target in yellow. 
The dark rectangular blocks are obstacles and the rockets will have to bypass them to hit the target.

This is my attempt to learn genetic evolution algorithms, and the  rockets learn from it's mistakes and becomes smart over time,
and after some time will perfectly hit the target.

Thank you Dan for teaching me this.
